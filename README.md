# Web Application
This project acts as a web template that uses Google Spreadsheets as a database to store and retrieve data. The project is also an extension to Google forms, but, however, can be extended to have more unrestricted options as HTML/CSS/JavaScript are involved. It uses Google Apps Script to communicate with Google Sheets.
